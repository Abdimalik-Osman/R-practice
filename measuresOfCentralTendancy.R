• A measure of central tendency is a measure which indicates where the
middle of the data is.
• The three most commonly used measures of central tendency are: the mean,
median and the mode.
The Mean:
  • It is the average of the data. 

The Median is the midpoint of the values after they have been
ordered from the smallest to the largest.
– There are as many values above the median as below it in
the data array.
– For an even set of values, the median will be the arithmetic
average of the two middle numbers.
There is a unique median for each data set.
⚫ It is not affected by extremely large or small values and is
therefore a valuable measure of central tendency when
such values occur.
⚫ It can be computed for ratio-level, interval-level, and
ordinal-level data.
