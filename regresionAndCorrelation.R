Correlation is a statistical measure for finding out the degree or strength
of the relationship between two variables. 
If two variables X and Y are so related that movements in one tend
to be accompanied by the corresponding movements in the other,
then X and Y are said to be correlated. 

The movements may be in the same direction (i.e., either both X and Y
increase or both of them decrease) or in opposite direction (i.e. one,
 X increases and the other, Y decreases).
positive or negative according as these movements are in 
the same or in opposite directions.
If Y is unaffected by any change in X, the X and Y are said to be 
uncorrelated.


The degree or extent of linear relationship between two variables
is measured by Karl Pearson’s coefficient of correlation or simply
correlation coefficient and denoted by “r”.
The extent or degree of correlation varies between -1 and +1, i.e., -1≤ r≤1.

There are five types of correlation depending on its extent and direction.
Perfect positive correlation: Here, the two variables X and Y are directly
proportional and fully correlated with each other (i.e. r = +1,
both variables rise or fall in the same proportion).

Perfect negative correlation: when one variable, X rises and other variable,
Y falls in the same proportion. In this case r = -1.
Partial positive correlation: in this case, 0< r <1.
Partial negative correlation: -1< r <0.
Absolutely no correlation: in this case, r = 0 indicating no
linear relationship exists between two variables.

A scatter plot is a graph of the ordered pairs (x, y) of numbers
consisting of the independent variable x and the dependent variable y.

The correlation coefficient computed from the sample data measures 
the strength and direction of a linear relationship between 
two quantitative variables. 
The symbol for the sample correlation coefficient is r. The symbol for 
the population correlation coefficient is  ρ.

The correlation coefficient suggests a strong relationship between 
the number of cars a rental agency has and its annual revenue.


In studying relationships between two variables:
  collect data and then construct a scatter plot. 
The purpose of the scatter plot, is to determine the nature of the 
relationship. compute the value of the correlation coefficient
If the value of the correlation coefficient is significant
the next step is to determine the equation of the regression line,
which is the data’s line of best fit. The purpose of the regression
model is To estimate the effect of the independent variable on the
dependent variable To predict the value of the dependent variable.

y=β0+β1x+u
defines the simple regression model.
y: dependent variable, explained variable, response variable,
predicted variable, regressand.
x: independent variable, explanatory variable, control variable,
predictor variable, regressor.
B0: intercept.
B1: slope parameter.
u: Error term, disturbance, unobservables.
variable y was explained in terms of variable x.
