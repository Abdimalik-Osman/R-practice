# The field of statistics has two main areas: mathematical statistics and
# applied statistics.
# • Mathematical statistics concerns the development of new methods of
# statistical inference and requires detailed knowledge of abstract
# mathematics for its implementation.
# • Applied statistics involves applying the methods of mathematical statistics
# to specific subject areas, such as economics, psychology, public health, etc.


# • Branches of Statistics
# • There are two primary types of statistics:
#   • Descriptive statistics refers to the collection, organization,
# presentation, and summarization of data (either using charts and
#                                          graphs or using a numerical summary).
# • Inferential statistics refers to generalizing from a sample to a
# population, estimating unknown parameters, drawing conclusions,
# and making decisions.


# Variable
# • The qualities or quantities about the units that can change from one unit to another.
# • It is a characteristic that takes on different values in different persons, places or things.
# For example:
#   • Heart rate, the heights of adult males, weights of preschool children
# Data
# • Consists of all the values of all the variables for all of the individuals we have chosen
# to observe.
# • Data is the plural of the Latin Datum (fact).


Quantitative variables can be measured in
the usual sense.
For example:
  • Heart rate, the heights of adult males,
• weights of schoolchildren
• The ages of employees seen in a
university
• Qualitative variables: Many characteristics are
not capable of being measured. Some of them can
be ordered or ranked.
For example:
  • Classification of people into socioeconomic
groups,
• Social classes based on income, education, etc.

A discrete variable is characterized by
gaps or interruptions in the values that
it can assume.
For example:
  • The number of daily admissions to a
university.
• The number of children someone has
Quantitative
variable
Discrete Continuous
• Continuous variables can assume any value
within a specified relevant interval of values
assumed by the variable.
For example:
  • Height
• Weight
• length


There are 4 levels of measurement:
  • Nominal (qualitative)
• Ordinal (Qualitative)
• Interval (Quantitative)
• Ratio (Quantitative)

• Ordinal data is data that comprises of categories that can be ranked or
ordered.
• Similarly, with nominal data the distance between each category cannot be
calculated, but the categories can be ranked above or below each other.
Examples
• Degree of illness: none, mild, moderate, acute, chronic.
• Opinion of students about stats class: very unhappy, unhappy, neural, happy,
delighted.


The difference between units now makes sense, but we can not talk about
ratios yet. The number zero does not represent absence in a real sense.
• Example:
  ✓Temperature in Celcius: 0°C is the degree that water freezes under
regular conditions. Does not mean there is no heat.
✓IQ is another example of an interval scale.


Zero means an absolute lack of that attribute, and the ratios of the numbers make
sense.

primary data: it is the data collected by a particular person or organization for his
or her own use from the primary sources.
• Secondary data: it is the data collected by some other person or organization for
his or her own use but the investigator can also use it. It means that data can be
primary for one person and secondary for the other.


Population: It is a collection of all possible individuals, objects, or
measurements of interest.

Sample survey is a study that collects planned information from a sample of
units in order to estimate particular population characteristics.
• Census is a study that aims to observe every member of a population.
• The fundamental purpose of the population census is to provide the facts
essential to government policy-making, planning and administration.

Parameter is a characteristic or value relating to the whole population
such as the population mean and population standard deviation.
• Statistic (estimator) is a characteristic or value relating to the sample such
as sample mean and sample standard deviation.

Data can be collected in a variety of ways. Some of the most common
methods are through the use of surveys.
• Observation
• Interviews
• Focus Group Discussion
• Questionnaire

To describe situations, draw conclusions, or make inferences about events, the
researcher must organize and display the data in some meaningful way. The
most convenient methods of organizing and displaying data are below:
  Qualitative variables:
  • Frequency distribution table
• Cross tabulation
• Bar chart
• Pie chart
• Pareto chart
Quantitative variables:
  Frequency distribution table
Time series plot
Histogram
Scatter plot
Stem and Leaf
