• A data set should be checked for extremely high or extremely low values. These
values are called outliers.

An outlier is an extremely high or an extremely low data value when 
compared with the rest of the data values.

A boxplot is a graph of a data set obtained by drawing a horizontal line 
from the minimum data value to Q1,drawing a horizontal line from Q3,
to the maximum data value, and drawing a box whose vertical sides pass
through Q1, Q1 and Q3, with a vertical line inside the box
passing through the median or Q1.

a. If the median is near the center of the box, the distribution is approximately symmetric.
b. If the median falls to the left of the center of the box, the distribution is positively skewed.
c. If the median falls to the right of the center of the box, the distribution is negatively skewed.

a. If the lines are about the same length, the distribution is approximately symmetric.
b. If the right line is larger than the left line, the distribution is positively skewed.
c. If the left line is larger than the right line, the distribution is negatively skewed.

• An outlier can strongly affect the mean and standard deviation of a variable.
For example, suppose a researcher mistakenly recorded an extremely high data
value.
• This value would then make the mean and standard deviation of the variable
much larger than they really were. Outliers can have an effect on other
statistics as well.

Why Study Dispersion?
  • A measure of location, such as the mean or the median, only describes the
center of the data. It is valuable from that standpoint, but it does not tell us
anything about the spread of the data.
• For example, if your nature guide told you that the river ahead averaged 3
feet in depth, would you want to wade across on foot without additional
information? Probably not. You would want to know something about the
variation in the depth.

• A second reason for studying the dispersion in a set of data is to compare
the spread in two or more distributions.

• Percentiles are position measures used in educational and health-related
fields to indicate the position of an individual in a group.
• Percentiles are used to compare an individual’s test score with the national
norm. For example, tests such as the National Educational Development Test
(NEDT) are taken by students in ninth or tenth grade. A student’s scores are
compared with those of other students locally and nationally by using
percentile ranks.

A dietitian is interested in comparing the sodium content of real cheese with the sodium
content of a cheese substitute. The data for two random samples are shown. Compare the
distributions, using boxplots.
